### 3D Audio Visualization: 

Taking advantage of the Web Audio API to render three dimensional animations driven by audio frequencies. Three dimensional animations created by use of Three.js by mapping the frequencies into segments, and interpreting the value change at any given time into a 3D representation.

### Functionality:

Two easy steps to get started:

- [ ] Navigate to the 'public' folder in your terminal
- [ ] Run 'npm start'


### How it's built:

This project is implemented with the following:

- `JavaScript` for game logic,
- `Three.js` for 3D modeling,
- `Webpack` to bundle js files.


### TODO:

- Incorporate an environmental effect like gravity on the audio-driven objects
- Allow user to control camera via mouse (Orbit Controls)
-User file upload
