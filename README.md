### Visynth

### 3D Audio Visualization
This project aims to take advantage of the Web Audio API to render three dimensional animations driven by the audio frequencies. It has high potential for being a very visually appealing project with many avenues for user interaction, as well as a promising way to showcase JavaScript skills. Also see it as an opportunity to tackle a more mathematically intensive project than I have done in the past.


### Functionality 

To get start:

- [ ] Navigate to folder in your terminal
- [ ] Run 'npm start'


### Architecture and Technologies

This project is implemented with the following technologies:

- `JavaScript` for game logic,
- `Three.js` for 3D modeling,
- `Webpack` to bundle js files.
- `SCSS` for styling and variables


### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**: Further familiarization with Three.js. Plan to initialize the logic for rendering a scene, camera, lighting. Configure a file upload for the mp3 file as well.

**Day 2**: Determine which scaling functions will be implemented to create the final product.  Will require a multitude of functions to receive the audio frequencies, scale/constrain them appropriately, and then map it unto a three dimensional rendering.  

**Day 3**: Ensure that the MVP is functional and extensible, and begin adding controls that allow for manipulation of the rendering. This might include the geometrical shape of objects displayed, the 'material' of the objects, the color scheme/response, etc.

### Bonus features

-Incorporate an environmental effect like gravity on the audio-driven objects
-Allow user to control camera via mouse
