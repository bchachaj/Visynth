### 3D Audio Visualization
This project takes advantage of the Web Audio API to render three dimensional animations driven by audio frequencies. Three dimensional animations created by use of Three.js, driven by the level of sound frequency supplied by the music. 

### Functionality

Two easy steps to get started:

- [ ] Navigate to the 'public' folder in your terminal
- [ ] Run 'npm start'


### Architecture and Technologies

This project is implemented with the following:

- `Three.js` for 3D modeling,
- `Webpack` to bundle js files.
- `CSS` for styling


### TBD:

- Incorporate an environmental effect like gravity on the audio-driven objects
- Allow user to control camera via mouse
